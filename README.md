gocoding
========

Gocoding is designed to provide a framework for creating flexible marshallers
and unmarshallers. It is designed for flexibility and modularity, not
scalability. It has not (yet) been optimized for speed and it can only handle
string lengths up to 1022 characters (not including quotes).
